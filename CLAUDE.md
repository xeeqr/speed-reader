## Commits and code style

- 2 space indents
- Always commit build and asset files
- One logical change per commit
- Keep commit messages concise (one line), use sentence case
- Update CHANGELOG.md after each change
- Use present tense in commits and CHANGELOG.md
- Use sentence case for headings (not Title Case)
- Never use bold text as headings, use proper heading levels instead
- Always add an empty line after headings
- No formatting in CHANGELOG.md except `inline code` and when absolute necessary
- Use `*` as bullets in CHANGELOG.md
- Never use Claude watermark in commits (FORBIDDEN: "Co-Authored-By")
- No emojis in commits or code
- Keep CHANGELOG.md date up to date when adding entries

## Claude Code workflow

- Always add tasks to the Claude Code to-do list and keep it up to date. Show todo list to user.
- Review your to-do list and prioritize before starting.
- If new tasks come in, don't jump to them right away—add them to the list in order of urgency and finish your current work first. Use FIFO (First in First out) in order.
- Do not ever guess features, always proof them via looking up official docs, GitHub code, issues, if possible.
- When looking things up, do not use years in search terms like 2024 or 2025.

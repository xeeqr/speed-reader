## What is RSVP?

RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) is a reading technique that displays text one word at a time at a fixed focal point. This eliminates saccades (eye movements) that normally slow down reading, allowing for significantly faster reading speeds.

## The science behind it

### Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)

When reading normally, your eyes don't land at the center of words. Research shows that fixations tend to occur slightly left of center, at what's called the Optimal Viewing Position (OVP) or Optimal Recognition Point (ORP). This position allows for fastest word recognition.

The ORP position follows the Spritz algorithm:

- 1 character: 1st letter
- 2-5 characters: 2nd letter
- 6-9 characters: 3rd letter
- 10-13 characters: 4th letter
- 14+ characters: 5th letter

### Fixed focal point

Traditional RSVP displays center each word, requiring small eye adjustments. This implementation aligns each word's ORP at the exact same screen position, so the highlighted letter never moves. Your eyes stay completely still while words flow around the focal point.

### Variable timing

The display time for each word is adjusted based on:

- Word length (longer words get more time)
- Punctuation (sentence-ending punctuation triggers a longer pause)

This mimics natural reading rhythm where comprehension requires variable processing time.

### Research findings

Studies have shown that RSVP reading can achieve speeds of 500+ words per minute, though comprehension tends to decrease above 350-400 WPM for complex texts. The technique works best for:

- Light reading and familiar content
- Skimming and preview reading
- Building reading speed gradually

Note: Extended RSVP reading can cause visual fatigue ([Benedetto et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.12.043)). Take breaks.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
